# ECDSA-C#-Implementation

📌 Overview

This project implements the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) in C#. The application demonstrates how public-key cryptography is used to ensure data integrity, authenticity, and non-repudiation.

🔐 What is ECDSA?

ECDSA is a public-key digital signature algorithm based on elliptic curve cryptography. It is commonly used in secure systems such as TLS, cryptocurrencies, and authentication mechanisms to verify that a message has not been altered and was signed by a trusted party.
